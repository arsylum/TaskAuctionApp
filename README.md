# Task Auction App

**Tool for organizing the chores of community living.**
The Task Aution is a tool for organizing the chores of community living. A system for efficient task distribution and transparency that was successfully implemented and used offline on paper for more than a year. We made it digital for ease of use, fanciness and automated data crunching.

You can use a demo [here](http://arsylum.enif.uberspace.de/demo/taskauction/). Feel free to play around with it, switch users, add new tasks, bid, or do whatever else. The auction gets reset periodically, so no changes you make will be permanent.

Please refer to the [wiki](https://github.com/arsylum/TaskAuctionApp/wiki/Home/) for the user manual, a set-up guide, and other joys.
