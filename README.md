# Task Auction App

**Tool for organizing the chores of community living.**
The Task Aution is a tool for organizing the chores of community living. A system for efficient task distribution and transparency that was successfully implemented and used offline on paper for more than a year. We made it digital for ease of use, fanciness and automated data crunching.

## Demo
[Check the demo](http://arsylum.enif.uberspace.de/demo/taskauction/) for a first impression. Feel free to play around with it, switch users, add new tasks, bid, or do whatever else. The auction gets reset periodically, so no changes you make will be permanent.

## Getting started
[The wiki](https://github.com/arsylum/TaskAuctionApp/wiki/Home/) provides more detailed information on what this is about. It also contains the [user manual](https://github.com/arsylum/TaskAuctionApp/wiki/User-Manual), a [set-up guide](https://github.com/arsylum/TaskAuctionApp/wiki/Technical-Setup), and other joys.
